Program Specification:

The program is a Python application that integrates two APIs: the Marketplace API and the Point-of-Sale API. The application will be triggered by a webhook called orderCreateWebhook from the Marketplace API. Upon receiving the webhook, the application will perform a series of steps involving HTTP requests to both APIs. The steps include creating an order, updating the order status, getting the menu, and publishing an error if any occurs. The application will also handle data mapping between each step according to the provided JSON mapping instructions.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `WebhookReceiver`: This class will handle the receipt of the webhook that triggers the workflow. It will parse the webhook data and initiate the workflow steps.

2. `APIClient`: This class will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs. It will handle the OAuth2 authentication for both APIs and will have methods for each of the required API endpoints (createOrder, updateOrderStatus, getMenu, publishError).

3. `DataMapper`: This class will handle the data mapping between each step of the workflow. It will take the JSON mapping instructions and apply them to the data from the webhook and the responses from the API requests.

4. `WorkflowManager`: This class will manage the overall workflow of the application. It will use the other classes to receive the webhook, make the API requests, and perform the data mapping.

5. `ErrorHandler`: This class will handle any errors that occur during the workflow. If an error occurs, it will use the APIClient to send a publishError request to the Marketplace API.

6. `main()`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create instances of the above classes and start the webhook receiver.

Note: Each class and function will also have appropriate methods for logging and error handling. The exact details of these will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
