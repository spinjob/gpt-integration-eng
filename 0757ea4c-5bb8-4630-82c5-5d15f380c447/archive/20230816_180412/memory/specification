Program Specification:

The program is a Python application that integrates two APIs: Point-of-Sale API and Marketplace API. The application will be triggered by a webhook called orderCreateWebhook from the Marketplace API. The webhook will be configured to send a POST request to a configured URL. 

The application will perform a series of steps, each step being an HTTP request to one of the two APIs. The steps are as follows:

1. Create an order in the Point-of-Sale API using data from the webhook.
2. Update the order status in the Marketplace API.
3. Get the menu from the Point-of-Sale API.
4. If there is an error in any of the previous steps, publish the error to the Marketplace API.

Each step involves data mapping from the input (webhook or previous step's response) to the output (request to the API). The data mapping is defined in a JSON format, specifying the source and target of each data field, and any transformations that need to be applied.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `WebhookHandler`: This class will handle the incoming webhook, parse the request, and trigger the workflow.
   - `handle_request(request: Request) -> None`: This method will be called when a webhook is received. It will parse the request and trigger the workflow.

2. `Workflow`: This class will manage the workflow, executing each step in sequence.
   - `execute() -> None`: This method will execute the workflow, calling each step in sequence.

3. `Step`: This class represents a step in the workflow. It will be subclassed for each specific step.
   - `execute() -> None`: This method will execute the step, making the HTTP request to the API and handling the response.

4. `DataMapper`: This class will handle the data mapping for each step.
   - `map(input: Dict, mapping: Dict) -> Dict`: This method will take the input data and a mapping definition, and return the mapped data.

5. `API`: This class represents an API. It will be subclassed for each specific API.
   - `request(method: str, path: str, headers: Dict, body: Dict) -> Dict`: This method will make an HTTP request to the API and return the response.

6. `OAuth2Client`: This class will handle the OAuth2 authentication for the APIs.
   - `get_token() -> str`: This method will get an access token from the OAuth2 server.
   - `request(method: str, path: str, headers: Dict, body: Dict) -> Dict`: This method will make an authenticated HTTP request to the API and return the response.

7. `Formula`: This class represents a transformation formula. It will be subclassed for each specific formula.
   - `apply(input: Any) -> Any`: This method will apply the formula to the input and return the result.

8. `ErrorPublisher`: This class will handle publishing errors to the Marketplace API.
   - `publish(error: Exception) -> None`: This method will publish an error to the API.
