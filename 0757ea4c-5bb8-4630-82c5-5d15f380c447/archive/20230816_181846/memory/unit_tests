Sure, here are the tests based on the above specification. We will use pytest for writing the tests.

test_main.py
```python
import pytest
from main import main

def test_main():
    assert main() is None
```

test_webhook_handler.py
```python
import pytest
from webhook_handler import WebhookHandler

def test_webhook_handler():
    webhook_handler = WebhookHandler()
    assert webhook_handler.handle_webhook() is None
```

test_api_client.py
```python
import pytest
from api_client import APIClient

def test_api_client():
    api_client = APIClient()
    assert api_client.make_request() is None
```

test_workflow.py
```python
import pytest
from workflow import Workflow

def test_workflow():
    workflow = Workflow()
    assert workflow.perform_step() is None
```

test_data_mapper.py
```python
import pytest
from data_mapper import DataMapper

def test_data_mapper():
    data_mapper = DataMapper()
    assert data_mapper.map_data() is None
```

test_authenticator.py
```python
import pytest
from authenticator import Authenticator

def test_authenticator():
    authenticator = Authenticator()
    assert authenticator.authenticate() is None
```

test_error_handler.py
```python
import pytest
from error_handler import ErrorHandler

def test_error_handler():
    error_handler = ErrorHandler()
    assert error_handler.handle_error() is None
```

Note: These are very basic tests that just check if the methods can be called without raising an exception. In a real-world scenario, you would want to write more comprehensive tests that check the actual functionality of the methods. For example, you might want to mock the APIs and check if the correct requests are being made, or you might want to check if the data mapping is done correctly. However, without more specific details about the APIs and the data mapping instructions, it's not possible to write these more detailed tests at this time.
