The core classes and functions that will be necessary for this task are:

1. `FileOrganizer`: This is the main class that will handle the organization of files. It will have methods to identify file types and move files to corresponding folders.

2. `get_file_type`: This function will identify the type of a file based on its extension.

3. `move_file`: This function will move a file from its current location to a new location.

4. `organize`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will take a directory as input and use the `FileOrganizer` class to organize the files in the directory.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
