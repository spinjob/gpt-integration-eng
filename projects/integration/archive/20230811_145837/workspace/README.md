The core classes and functions that will be necessary are:

1. `FileOrganizer`: This is the main class that will handle the organization of files. It will have methods to identify file types and move files to corresponding folders.

2. `get_file_type`: This function will identify the file type based on the file extension.

3. `move_file`: This function will move the file to the corresponding folder.

4. `organize`: This function will iterate over all files in the directory and organize them.

5. `main`: This is the entry point of the CLI tool. It will parse command line arguments and call the `organize` function.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`requirements.txt`
