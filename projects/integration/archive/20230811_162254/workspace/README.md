The core classes and functions that will be necessary for this task are:

1. `FileOrganizer`: This class will be responsible for the main functionality of the tool. It will have methods to scan the directory, identify file types, and move files to corresponding folders.

2. `get_file_type`: This function will be used to determine the file type based on the file extension.

3. `move_file`: This function will be used to move a file from one directory to another.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the CLI tool. It will parse command line arguments and call the appropriate methods of the `FileOrganizer` class.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
