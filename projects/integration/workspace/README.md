The architecture of the solution will consist of the following files:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the main function that will be executed to run the integration process.

2. `api_client.py`: This file will contain the `APIClient` class which will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs.

3. `token_generator.py`: This file will contain the `TokenGenerator` class which will be responsible for generating bearer tokens for the APIs.

4. `data_transformer.py`: This file will contain the `DataTransformer` class which will be responsible for transforming the data received from API #1 to the format required by API #2.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file will contain the list of Python packages required to run the application.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`main.py`
