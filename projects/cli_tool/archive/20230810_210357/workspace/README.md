Assumptions:
1. The project is a simple Python application that fetches data from an API and processes it.
2. The application uses the requests library to make HTTP requests.
3. The application uses the json library to parse JSON responses.
4. The application uses pytest for testing.
5. The application is structured in a modular way, with separate files for different functionalities.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `APIClient`: This class is responsible for making HTTP requests to the API.
2. `process_data`: This function takes the data fetched from the API and processes it.
3. `main`: This is the entry point of the application. It calls the other functions and methods to fetch and process data.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
