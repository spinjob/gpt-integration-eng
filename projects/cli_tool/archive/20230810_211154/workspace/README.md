Assumptions:
1. The task is to create a Python application.
2. The application is a simple command-line tool that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
3. The application will be structured in a modular way, with separate files for the main execution, string processing logic, and tests.
4. The application will use the pytest framework for testing.
5. The application will be packaged using setuptools, so it can be easily installed and run.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It contains the main function which handles command-line arguments and calls the appropriate function from the `string_processor.py` module.
2. `string_processor.py`: This module contains the `reverse_string` function which takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
3. `test_string_processor.py`: This module contains the `TestStringProcessor` class with a method `test_reverse_string` for testing the `reverse_string` function.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
