We are creating a simple Python application that fetches data from an API, processes it, and stores it in a database.\n2. The application will be structured using an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.\n3. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API.\n4. The application will use SQLite as the database.\n5. The application will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.\n6. The application will use pytest for testing.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, Methods:\n1. `APIHandler`: This class will handle fetching data from the API.\n2. `DatabaseHandler`: This class will handle all database operations.\n3. `DataProcessor`: This class will handle processing of the data fetched from the API.\n4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application.\n\nNow, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom api_handler import APIHandler\nfrom database_handler import DatabaseHandler\nfrom data_processor import DataProcessor\n\ndef main():\n    api_handler = APIHandler()\n    data_processor = DataProcessor()\n    database_handler = DatabaseHandler()\n\n    raw_data = api_handler.fetch_data()\n    processed_data = data_processor.process_data(raw_data)\n    database_handler.store_data(processed_data)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nNext, let's move on to the `APIHandler` class in `api_handler.py`.\n\napi_handler.py\n```python\nimport requests\n\nclass APIHandler:\n    def __init__(self, url=\"https://api.example.com/data\"):\n        self.url = url\n\n    def fetch_data(self):\n        response = requests.get(self.url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n```\n\nNext, the `DataProcessor` class in `data_processor.py`.\n\ndata_processor.py\n```python\nclass DataProcessor:\n    def process_data(self, raw_data):\n        # Placeholder for data processing logic\n        return raw_data\n```\n\nNext, the `DatabaseHandler` class in `database_handler.py`.\n\ndatabase_handler.py\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nclass DatabaseHandler:\n    def __init__(self, db_url=\"sqlite:///data.db\"):\n        self.engine = create_engine(db_url)\n        self.Session = sessionmaker(bind=self.engine)\n\n    def store_data(self, data):\n        session = self.Session()\n        # Placeholder for data storing logic\n        session.commit()\n```\n\nFinally, let's create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the dependencies.\n\nrequirements.txt\n```\nrequests\nsqlalchemy\npytest\n```\n\nThis completes the basic structure of the application.
