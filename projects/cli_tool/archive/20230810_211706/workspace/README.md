Assumptions:
1. We are creating a simple Python application that fetches data from an API, processes it, and stores it in a database.
2. The application will be structured using an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
3. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API.
4. The application will use SQLite as the database.
5. The application will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.
6. The application will use pytest for testing.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `APIHandler`: This class will handle fetching data from the API.
2. `DatabaseHandler`: This class will handle all database operations.
3. `DataProcessor`: This class will handle processing of the data fetched from the API.
4. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.
