The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for this task are:

1. `argparse` module: This will be used to parse command line arguments.
2. `PIL` module: This is the Pillow library that will be used for image manipulation.
3. `resize_image` function: This function will take an image path, width, and height as arguments and resize the image accordingly.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.
