The program is a Python3 application that integrates two APIs, the Marketplace API and the Point-of-Sale API. The application will be triggered by a webhook or on a scheduled cadence. The application will implement a series of workflow steps, each step being an HTTP request to one of the two APIs. The data mapping between each step will be according to the provided JSON instructions.

The program should have the following features:

1. Authentication: The program should be able to authenticate with both APIs using the OAuth2 client credentials flow. The client_id, client_secret, scope, and grant_type for each API will be manually configured.

2. Webhook Trigger: The program should be able to receive a webhook POST request from the Marketplace API and trigger the workflow.

3. Workflow Steps: The program should be able to execute a series of HTTP requests to the APIs according to the workflow steps. The HTTP requests will include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods.

4. Data Mapping: The program should be able to map and adapt data between each workflow step according to the provided JSON instructions. The data mapping includes finding input data, applying formulas to the input value, and setting the output value.

5. Error Handling: The program should be able to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. If an error occurs, the program should log the error and continue with the next step if possible.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `OAuth2Client`: This class will handle the OAuth2 client credentials flow for both APIs. It will have methods like `get_access_token()` to get an access token and `refresh_access_token()` to refresh an expired access token.

2. `WebhookHandler`: This class will handle the webhook trigger. It will have a method like `handle_webhook()` that will be called when a webhook POST request is received.

3. `WorkflowExecutor`: This class will execute the workflow steps. It will have a method like `execute_step()` that will execute a single workflow step, and a method like `execute_workflow()` that will execute all workflow steps.

4. `DataMapper`: This class will handle the data mapping between each workflow step. It will have methods like `find_input_data()`, `apply_formula()`, and `set_output_value()`.

5. `ErrorHandler`: This class will handle errors and exceptions. It will have a method like `handle_error()` that will be called when an error or exception occurs.

6. `main()`: This function will be the entry point of the program. It will create instances of the above classes and coordinate the execution of the program.
