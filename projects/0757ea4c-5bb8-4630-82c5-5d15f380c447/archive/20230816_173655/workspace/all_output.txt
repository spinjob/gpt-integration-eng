The code provided above doesn't seem to have any syntax errors. However, the error message suggests that the Python command is not found in the system where this code is being run. This could be due to Python not being installed or not being in the system's PATH.

If Python is not installed, it can be installed by following the official Python installation guide: https://www.python.org/downloads/

If Python is installed but not in the system's PATH, you can add it to the PATH by following these steps:

- On Windows:
  1. Search for 'Environment Variables' in your computer's search bar and select 'Edit the system environment variables'.
  2. Click on 'Environment Variables'.
  3. Under 'System variables', find the 'Path' variable, select it, and click on 'Edit'.
  4. In the 'Edit environment variable' dialog, click on 'New'.
  5. Type in the path to the directory where Python is installed. This is usually `C:\PythonXX\`, where `XX` is the Python version.
  6. Click 'OK' in all dialogs to apply the changes.

- On Unix-based systems (like Linux or MacOS):
  1. Open a terminal.
  2. Open the `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file with a text editor. For example, you can type `nano ~/.bashrc`.
  3. At the end of the file, add the line `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/python`, replacing `/path/to/python` with the path to the directory where Python is installed.
  4. Save the file and exit the text editor.
  5. In the terminal, type `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` to apply the changes.

After following these steps, the `python` command should be recognized by the system.
