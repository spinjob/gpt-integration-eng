The architecture of the application will be divided into several Python files, each with a specific purpose. The main files will be:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will handle the webhook trigger and control the workflow of the application.

2. `api.py`: This file will contain the classes for the two APIs (Point-of-Sale API and Marketplace API). Each class will have methods for each API endpoint that needs to be called.

3. `auth.py`: This file will handle the OAuth2 authentication for both APIs.

4. `data_mapping.py`: This file will contain the logic for mapping the data between the APIs according to the provided JSON.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that need to be installed for the application to run.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`requirements.txt`
