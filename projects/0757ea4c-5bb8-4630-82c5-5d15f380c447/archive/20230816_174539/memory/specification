Program Specification:

The program is a Python3 application that integrates two APIs, the Marketplace API and the Point-of-Sale API. The application will be triggered by a webhook called orderCreateWebhook from the Marketplace API. The webhook will be configured to send a POST request to a configured URL. 

The application will perform a series of steps, each step being an HTTP request to one of the two involved APIs. The steps are as follows:

1. Create an order in the Point-of-Sale API using data from the webhook trigger.
2. Update the order status in the Marketplace API.
3. Get the menu from the Point-of-Sale API.
4. If there is an error in any of the previous steps, publish the error to the Marketplace API.

The data mapping between each step will be according to the provided JSON mapping instructions. 

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `WebhookHandler`: This class will handle the incoming webhook from the Marketplace API. It will parse the webhook data and trigger the workflow.

2. `APIClient`: This class will handle all interactions with the APIs. It will have methods for each of the API endpoints that need to be called in the workflow.

3. `DataMapper`: This class will handle the data mapping between each step of the workflow. It will take the JSON mapping instructions and apply them to the data.

4. `WorkflowManager`: This class will manage the workflow. It will call the appropriate methods on the `APIClient` and `DataMapper` classes in the correct order.

5. `ErrorHandler`: This class will handle any errors that occur during the workflow. It will publish the error to the Marketplace API using the `APIClient`.

6. `main()`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create instances of the above classes and start the workflow when a webhook is received.

7. `get_auth_token(api_name)`: This function will handle the OAuth2 authentication for both APIs. It will return the access token that will be used for API requests.

8. `if_then(input_value, condition, then_value, else_value)`: This function will implement the "If, then" formula used in the data mapping.

9. `substring(input_value, starting_index, ending_index)`: This function will implement the "Substring" formula used in the data mapping.

10. `prepend(input_value, prepend_value)`: This function will implement the "Prepend" formula used in the data mapping.

11. `division(input_value, divisor)`: This function will implement the "Division" formula used in the data mapping.
