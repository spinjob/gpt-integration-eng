The project will be implemented in Python and will use the following libraries:
- Flask: to create a web server that will receive the webhook POST request.
- Requests: to make HTTP requests to the APIs.
- Python-dotenv: to manage environment variables.
- Pytest: for testing.

The project will be structured as follows:
- `main.py`: the entry point of the application. It will contain the Flask application and the route that will receive the webhook POST request.
- `api.py`: this file will contain the `API` class, which will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs.
- `workflow.py`: this file will contain the `Workflow` class, which will be responsible for executing the workflow steps.
- `data_mapping.py`: this file will contain the `DataMapping` class, which will be responsible for mapping the data between the webhook, the workflow steps, and the APIs.
- `requirements.txt`: this file will list the Python libraries that the project depends on.
- `.env`: this file will contain the environment variables, such as the API base URLs, the client IDs, and the client secrets.
- `test_main.py`, `test_api.py`, `test_workflow.py`, `test_data_mapping.py`: these files will contain the tests for the corresponding classes.

Let's start with the `requirements.txt` file:
