The architecture of the application will be divided into several Python files, each containing a specific class or function. The main files will be:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will handle the triggering of the workflow and the execution of each step.

2. `api.py`: This file will contain the `API` class, which will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs.

3. `auth.py`: This file will contain the `Auth` class, which will handle the OAuth2 authentication for the APIs.

4. `workflow.py`: This file will contain the `Workflow` class, which will manage the execution of the workflow steps.

5. `data_mapping.py`: This file will contain the `DataMapping` class, which will handle the mapping and transformation of data between the APIs.

6. `formulas.py`: This file will contain various functions that will be used in the formulas for data transformation.

7. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that are required to run the application.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`main.py`
