The architecture of the application will be divided into several parts:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will handle the webhook trigger and initiate the workflow.

2. `api_client.py`: This module will contain the `APIClient` class which will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs.

3. `auth.py`: This module will contain the `OAuth2ClientCredentials` class which will handle the OAuth2 client credentials flow for both APIs.

4. `workflow.py`: This module will contain the `Workflow` class which will execute the workflow steps.

5. `data_mapper.py`: This module will contain the `DataMapper` class which will handle the data mapping between each step.

6. `formulas.py`: This module will contain the functions for the formulas used in the data mapping.

7. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies required by the application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`main.py`
