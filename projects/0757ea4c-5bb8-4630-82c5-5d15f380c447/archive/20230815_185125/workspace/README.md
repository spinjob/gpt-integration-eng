The architecture of the application will consist of several Python files, each containing a specific class or function. The main components of the application will be:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the main function that triggers the workflow.

2. `api.py`: This file will contain the `API` class that handles all API-related operations such as sending requests and handling responses.

3. `auth.py`: This file will contain the `Auth` class that handles the authentication process for both APIs.

4. `workflow.py`: This file will contain the `Workflow` class that manages the workflow steps and data mapping.

5. `webhook.py`: This file will contain the `Webhook` class that handles the webhook trigger.

6. `utils.py`: This file will contain utility functions used throughout the application.

7. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages required to run the application.

Let's start with the `main.py` file:
