The project will be structured as follows:

- `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will handle the webhook trigger and execute the workflow steps.
- `api.py`: This file will contain the `API` class which will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs.
- `auth.py`: This file will contain the `Auth` class which will handle the OAuth2 authentication for the APIs.
- `workflow.py`: This file will contain the `Workflow` class which will handle the execution of the workflow steps.
- `data_mapping.py`: This file will contain the `DataMapping` class which will handle the mapping of data between the webhook trigger and the API requests.
- `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies required by the project.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`main.py`
