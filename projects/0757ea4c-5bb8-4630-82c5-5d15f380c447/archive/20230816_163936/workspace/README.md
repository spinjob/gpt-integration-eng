The architecture of the application will be divided into several Python files, each responsible for a specific part of the application. The main files will be:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will handle the webhook trigger and orchestrate the workflow steps.

2. `api_client.py`: This file will contain the `APIClient` class, which will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs.

3. `auth.py`: This file will contain the `OAuth2ClientCredentials` class, which will handle the OAuth2 client credentials flow for both APIs.

4. `data_mapper.py`: This file will contain the `DataMapper` class, which will handle the mapping of data between the webhook, the APIs, and the workflow steps.

5. `formulas.py`: This file will contain various formula functions that will be used in the data mapping process.

6. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that the application depends on.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`main.py`
