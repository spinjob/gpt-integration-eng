The architecture of the application will consist of several Python files, each responsible for a specific part of the application. The main components of the application will be:

1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will handle the webhook trigger and orchestrate the workflow steps.

2. `api_client.py`: This file will contain the `APIClient` class, which will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs.

3. `auth.py`: This file will contain the `OAuth2ClientCredentials` class, which will handle the OAuth2 client credentials flow for both APIs.

4. `data_mapper.py`: This file will contain the `DataMapper` class, which will handle the mapping of data between the webhook request, API responses, and API requests according to the provided Data Mapping JSON.

5. `formulas.py`: This file will contain functions for the formulas used in the Data Mapping JSON.

6. `requirements.txt`: This file will list the Python packages required by the application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
