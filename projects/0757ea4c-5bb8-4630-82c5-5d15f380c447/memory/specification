Program Specification:

The program is a Python application that integrates two APIs: the Marketplace API and the Point-of-Sale API. The application will be triggered by a webhook called orderCreateWebhook from the Marketplace API. The webhook will be configured to send a POST request to a configured URL. 

The application will perform a series of steps, each step being an HTTP request to one of the two APIs. The steps are as follows:

1. Create an order in the Point-of-Sale API using data from the webhook.
2. Update the order status in the Marketplace API.
3. Get the menu from the Point-of-Sale API.
4. If there is an error in any of the previous steps, publish the error to the Marketplace API.

Each step involves data mapping from the input (webhook or previous step's response) to the output (request to the API). The data mapping will follow the provided Data Mapping JSON.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:

1. `WebhookHandler`: This class will handle the incoming webhook. It will parse the webhook data and trigger the workflow.

2. `APIClient`: This class will handle the communication with the APIs. It will have methods for each API endpoint that the workflow interacts with.

3. `DataMapper`: This class will handle the data mapping from the input to the output. It will use the provided Data Mapping JSON to perform the mapping.

4. `Workflow`: This class will orchestrate the workflow. It will call the appropriate methods of the `APIClient` class in the correct order, using the `DataMapper` to map the data between steps.

5. `ErrorHandler`: This class will handle any errors that occur during the workflow. It will use the `APIClient` to publish the error to the Marketplace API.

6. `TokenGenerator`: This class will handle the generation of tokens for the OAuth2 authentication of the APIs.

7. `main()`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will instantiate the `WebhookHandler` and start the webhook server.

8. `ifthen()`, `substring()`, `prepend()`, `division()`: These functions will implement the formulas used in the data mapping. They will be called by the `DataMapper` as needed.

9. `start_webhook_server()`: This function will start the webhook server. It will be called by the `main()` function.

10. `stop_webhook_server()`: This function will stop the webhook server. It will be called when the application is shutting down.
