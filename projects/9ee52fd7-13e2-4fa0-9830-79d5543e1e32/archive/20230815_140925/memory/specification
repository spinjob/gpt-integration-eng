Program Specification:

The program is a Python application that integrates two APIs, namely the Marketplace API and the Point-of-Sale API. Both APIs use OAuth2 for authentication. The application will perform a series of steps, each step being an HTTP request to one of the two APIs. The steps are triggered by a specific condition, referred to as the "workflow trigger". 

The application will perform the following steps:

1. Get the menu from the Marketplace API. The request will include a header parameter 'X-Store-Id' which is obtained from the configuration.

2. Upsert the menu to the Point-of-Sale API. The request will include a body parameter 'categories' and 'modifierGroups' which are obtained from the response of the previous step.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `OAuth2Client` class: This class will handle the OAuth2 authentication for both APIs. It will have methods to get and refresh access tokens.

2. `APIRequest` class: This class will handle making HTTP requests to the APIs. It will have methods for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

3. `DataMapper` class: This class will handle mapping and adapting values from the configuration, webhook request body, or previous HTTP requests response body. It will have methods to extract and transform data according to the Data Mapping JSON.

4. `Workflow` class: This class will handle the execution of the workflow steps. It will have methods to execute each step and handle the workflow trigger.

5. `get_menu` function: This function will use the `APIRequest` class to make a GET request to the Marketplace API to get the menu.

6. `upsert_menu` function: This function will use the `APIRequest` class to make a POST request to the Point-of-Sale API to upsert the menu.

7. `main` function: This is the entry point of the application. It will create instances of the `OAuth2Client`, `APIRequest`, `DataMapper`, and `Workflow` classes, and execute the workflow steps.

Note: The actual implementation may require additional helper functions or methods, depending on the specific requirements of the APIs and the data mapping logic.
