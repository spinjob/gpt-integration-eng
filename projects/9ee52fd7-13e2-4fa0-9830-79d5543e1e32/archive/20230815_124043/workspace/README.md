The application will be implemented in Node.js and will use the following libraries:

- `axios` for making HTTP requests
- `dotenv` for loading environment variables
- `jsonwebtoken` for handling JWT tokens
- `express` for setting up a server to listen for the workflow trigger

The application will consist of the following files:

- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application. It sets up an Express server that listens for the workflow trigger and initiates the workflow steps.
- `apiClient.js`: This file contains the `APIClient` class, which is responsible for making authenticated requests to the APIs.
- `workflow.js`: This file contains the `Workflow` class, which is responsible for executing the workflow steps.
- `.env`: This file contains environment variables such as the API keys.
- `package.json`: This file contains the project metadata and dependencies.

Let's start with the `package.json` file:
