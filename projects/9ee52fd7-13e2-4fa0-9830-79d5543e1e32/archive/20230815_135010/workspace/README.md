The architecture of the application will be as follows:

1. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of the application. It will handle the workflow and call the necessary functions to interact with the APIs.

2. `api_handler.py`: This file will contain the `APIHandler` class which will be responsible for interacting with the APIs. It will have methods to send GET and POST requests, handle OAuth2 authentication, and parse the response.

3. `data_mapper.py`: This file will contain the `DataMapper` class which will be responsible for mapping the data from the response of one API to the request of the other API according to the provided mapping JSON.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies required by the application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`main.py`
