Program Specification:

The program is a Python application that integrates two APIs, namely the Point-of-Sale API and the Marketplace API. The application will be triggered by a webhook called menuPublishWebhook from the Marketplace API. The webhook will send a POST request to a configured URL, which will trigger the workflow of the application. 

The workflow consists of two steps. In the first step, the application will make a GET request to the getMenu endpoint of the Marketplace API. The request will include a header parameter X-Store-Id, which will be extracted from the body of the webhook trigger. 

In the second step, the application will make a POST request to the upsertMenu endpoint of the Point-of-Sale API. The request body will include data mapped from the response of the getMenu request. The mapping will be done according to the provided Data Mapping JSON.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `WebhookHandler`: This class will handle the incoming webhook trigger. It will extract necessary data from the webhook body and initiate the workflow.

2. `APIRequester`: This class will be responsible for making HTTP requests to the APIs. It will include methods for different types of requests, such as GET and POST.

3. `DataMapper`: This class will handle the mapping of data from one API response to another API request. It will use the provided Data Mapping JSON to perform the mapping.

4. `OAuth2Authenticator`: This class will handle the OAuth2 authentication for the APIs. It will include methods to obtain and refresh access tokens.

5. `WorkflowManager`: This class will manage the overall workflow of the application. It will use the other classes to handle the webhook, make API requests, map data, and handle authentication.

6. `main()`: This is the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of the WorkflowManager and start the workflow.

Note: Each class will be placed in its own Python file with the same name (in lowercase). The main function will be placed in a file named main.py. The program will also include a requirements.txt file to list the Python packages needed to run the application.
