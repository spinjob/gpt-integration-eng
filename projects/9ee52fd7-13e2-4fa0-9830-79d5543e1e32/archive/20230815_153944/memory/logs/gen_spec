An engineer will rely on your initial implementation to run succesfully.  Please provide comments as you implement to allow a developer to understand the components of the implementation.\n\nAPI Context and Instructions: There are two REST Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) whose supported authentication schemes, requests, and data models that will be referenced in the requirements for this application.  In this section we define two categories of API information (1) The base URLs for a production and or a sandbox server for each API. These can be used to build the full HTTP request paths. (2) The Authentication or Security Scheme supported by the API.  Each APIs authentication scheme needs to be adhered to when you develop the project, so implement the project accordingly. \n\nAPI (identifier: 2389bc50-2646-4e94-bb34-86c9ea23cd7e) Name: Marketplace

trigger\" and series of sequential \"workflow steps.\" A workflow trigger is the definition of the condition required to run the application.  Each step will be an HTTP request to one of the two involved APIs. \n\n Workflow Trigger Instructions: The workflow will be triggered by a webhook called menuPublishWebhook from API (2389bc50-2646-4e94-bb34-86c9ea23cd7e).  The webhook will be configured to send a POST request to a configured URL.  Use a placeholder for the webhook URL.\n\nWorkflow Steps Instructions: The following series of steps will contain a combination of text and JSON to describe each HTTP request.  The text will describe the details of the HTTP request (the API that supports the request, the HTTP method, and the path to append to the server base URL for the API.  \n\n The Data Mapping JSON will provide you detailed instructions on how to map and adapt a value coming from a configuration, webhook request body, or previous HTTP requests response body. The keys of the object represent either the key of a header/path/query parameter OR a dot-notation representation of a property in a request body. To help navigate the Data Mapping JSON, here are descriptions of its primary properties \n\n (MAPPING JSON PROPERTY: .input): The source of the value to use for the output property.  It will include an \"in\" property that will tell you where in the previous step to look for it; if it is \"body\" and the sourceNode is \"trigger\", then you will find the source value in the body of the webhook trigger.  If \"in\" is \"body\" and the sourceNode is an \"action\" then you will find the value in the response body of the previous steps HTTP request.  The \"sourcePath\" of the \"input\" is a dot-notation representation of where the property is located in an object like a webhook or response body. \n\n (MAPPING JSON PROPERTY .input.formulas) This array contains objects that each describe a function to apply to the input value to create the output value. The functions described should be applied in the order they appearin the array. If no \"formulas\" property exists or its empty for an input that means you should assume the value of the input is set to the output property without changing it.  \n\n (MAPPING JSON PROPERTY: .output) The details of the parameter or property that will contain the value from the input in the current steps HTTP request. The \"output.in\" value will tell you if the property is a header parameter, path parameter, query parameter, or a propert in the request body.  If \"in\" === \"body, then \"outputPath\" will describe a dot-notation representation of where the property is in the request body object.\n\nStep 1: API (identifier:2389bc50-2646-4e94-bb34-86c9ea23cd7e) getMenu\nStep 1 Data Mapping JSON:\n{\n  \"X-Store-Id\": {\n    \"id\": \"22633e6a-2fa3-4afc-9b0a-170758834518\",\n    \"stepIndex\": 1,\n    \"input\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"The unique identifier of the store in the partner application.

The application will be triggered by a webhook called menuPublishWebhook from the Marketplace API. Upon receiving the webhook, the application will perform a series of HTTP requests to both APIs according to a predefined workflow.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. Webhook Listener: The application should have a feature to listen for incoming webhooks from the Marketplace API. The webhook will be a POST request to a configured URL.\n\n2. OAuth2 Authentication: The application should be able to authenticate with both APIs using the OAuth2 client credentials flow. The application should be able to request and refresh access tokens as needed.\n\n3. HTTP Request Handling: The application should be able to perform HTTP requests to both APIs. The requests will be defined by a series of workflow steps, each of which will be an HTTP request to one of the APIs.\n\n4. Data Mapping: The application should be able to map and adapt data from the webhook request body or previous HTTP request response bodies to the parameters or properties of the current HTTP request. The mapping instructions will be provided in a JSON format.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, and Methods:\n\n1. `WebhookListener`: This class will handle incoming webhooks from the Marketplace API.\n    - `listen()`: This method will start the webhook listener.\n\n2. `OAuth2Client`: This class will handle OAuth2 authentication with both APIs.\n    - `request_token(api_id: str)`: This method will request an access token from the specified API.\n    - `refresh_token(api_id: str)`: This method will refresh the access token for the specified API.\n\n3. `APIRequestHandler`: This class will handle HTTP requests to both APIs.\n    - `perform_request(api_id: str, request_data: dict)`: This method will perform an HTTP request to the specified API with the provided request data.\n\n4. `DataMapper`: This class will handle data mapping between the webhook request body or previous HTTP request response bodies and the current HTTP request.\n    - `map_data(mapping_instructions: dict, source_data: dict)`: This method will map data from the source data according to the mapping instructions.\n\n5. `WorkflowManager`: This class will manage the execution of the workflow steps.\n    - `execute_workflow(webhook_data: dict)`: This method will execute the workflow steps using the provided webhook data.\n\n6. `main()`: This function will start the application. It will initialize the `WebhookListener`, `OAuth2Client`, `APIRequestHandler`, `DataMapper`, and `WorkflowManager` and start the webhook listener.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
