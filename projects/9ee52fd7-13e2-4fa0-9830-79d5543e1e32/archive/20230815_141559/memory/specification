Program Specification:

The program is a Python application that integrates two APIs: Point-of-Sale API and Marketplace API. Both APIs use OAuth2 for authentication. The program is triggered by a webhook called menuPublishWebhook from the Marketplace API. The webhook sends a POST request to a configured URL. The program then performs a series of steps, each of which is an HTTP request to one of the two APIs. The data mapping for each step is provided in JSON format.

The program should have the following features:

1. Handle the webhook trigger and extract necessary data from the webhook request body.
2. Perform OAuth2 authentication for both APIs.
3. Perform HTTP requests to the APIs according to the workflow steps.
4. Handle the data mapping for each step according to the provided JSON.
5. Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the process.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `WebhookHandler`: This class handles the webhook trigger. It has a method `handle_trigger` that takes the webhook request as input and extracts necessary data.

2. `OAuth2Authenticator`: This class handles OAuth2 authentication for the APIs. It has a method `authenticate` that takes the API credentials as input and returns an access token.

3. `APIRequester`: This class performs HTTP requests to the APIs. It has a method `request` that takes the HTTP method, URL, headers, and body as input and returns the response.

4. `DataMapper`: This class handles the data mapping for each step. It has a method `map_data` that takes the input data and mapping JSON as input and returns the output data.

5. `WorkflowExecutor`: This class executes the workflow steps. It has a method `execute_step` that takes the step index, API, method, URL, headers, body, and data mapping as input and performs the corresponding API request.

6. `ErrorHandler`: This class handles any errors or exceptions that may occur during the process. It has a method `handle_error` that takes an exception as input and logs the error message.

7. `main`: This is the main function of the program. It initializes the classes, handles the webhook trigger, performs the workflow steps, and handles any errors or exceptions.
