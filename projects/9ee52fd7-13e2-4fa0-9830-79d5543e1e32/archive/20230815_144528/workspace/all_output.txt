The provided code seems to be logically correct and well-structured. However, without a specific error message or a detailed description of the expected behavior, it's hard to identify any potential issues. 

One thing to note is that the OAuth2Authenticator class has a placeholder method for authentication. In a real-world application, this method should be implemented to authenticate with the API and return an access token. 

Here's how you might implement it using the requests library and assuming the API follows a standard OAuth2 flow:

oauth2_authenticator.py
```python
import requests

class OAuth2Authenticator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client_id = 'your_client_id'
        self.client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
        self.token_url = 'https://partners.cloudkitchens.com/oauth/token'

    def authenticate(self, api_id):
        data = {
            'grant_type': 'client_credentials',
            'client_id': self.client_id,
            'client_secret': self.client_secret,
            'audience': api_id
        }
        response = requests.post(self.token_url, data=data)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception if the request failed
        return response.json()['access_token']
```

Please replace 'your_client_id' and 'your_client_secret' with your actual client ID and client secret. The 'audience' parameter might also need to be adjusted depending on the specifics of the API's authentication scheme.

Also, please note that error handling is minimal in the provided code. In a production environment, you would want to add more robust error handling to deal with potential issues like network errors, API errors, or data format inconsistencies.
