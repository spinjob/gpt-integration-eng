Based on the provided information, we will need to create a Node.js application that integrates two APIs using OAuth2 authentication. The application will perform two steps: 

1. Get a menu from the Marketplace API.
2. Upsert the menu to the Point-of-Sale API.

The application will need to handle OAuth2 authentication for both APIs, make HTTP requests, and map data between the APIs according to the provided mapping JSON.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `OAuth2Client` class: This class will handle OAuth2 authentication for an API. It will have methods to get an access token and refresh it when necessary.

2. `ApiRequest` class: This class will handle making HTTP requests to an API. It will use an instance of `OAuth2Client` to handle authentication.

3. `DataMapper` class: This class will handle mapping data between APIs according to the provided mapping JSON. It will have methods to map data from a source object to a target object.

4. `Workflow` class: This class will handle the overall workflow of the application. It will use instances of `ApiRequest` and `DataMapper` to perform the steps of the workflow.

5. `main` function: This is the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of `Workflow` and run it.

Now, let's implement these classes and functions in code.

`package.json`
