Assumptions:
1. The project is a simple Python application that fetches data from an API and processes it.
2. The application uses the requests library to fetch data from the API.
3. The application uses the pandas library to process the data.
4. The application is structured in a modular way, with separate files for different functionalities.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `APIClient`: This class is responsible for fetching data from the API.
2. `DataProcessor`: This class is responsible for processing the data fetched from the API.
3. `main()`: This is the entry point of the application. It coordinates the fetching and processing of data.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
