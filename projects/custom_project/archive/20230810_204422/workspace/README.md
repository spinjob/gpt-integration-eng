Assumptions:
1. We are creating a simple Python application that fetches data from an API and processes it.
2. The application will be structured in a modular way, with separate files for different functionalities.
3. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API.
4. The application will use the json library to parse the fetched data.
5. The application will use pytest for testing.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the main function which will call other functions to fetch and process data.
2. `api.py`: This file will contain the `fetch_data` function which will be responsible for fetching data from the API.
3. `processor.py`: This file will contain the `process_data` function which will be responsible for processing the fetched data.
4. `test.py`: This file will contain the test cases for the application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
