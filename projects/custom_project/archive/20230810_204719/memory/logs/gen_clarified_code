We are creating a Python application.\n2. The application is a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).\n3. The application will be structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.\n4. The application will be packaged and distributed using setuptools.\n5. The application will have unit tests using pytest.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, and Methods:\n1. Calculator class: This is the main class that performs the arithmetic operations.\n   - add method: Adds two numbers.\n   - subtract method: Subtracts one number from another.\n   - multiply method: Multiplies two numbers.\n   - divide method: Divides one number by another.\n2. main function: This is the entry point of the application.
