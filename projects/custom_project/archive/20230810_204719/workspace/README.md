Assumptions:
1. We are creating a Python application.
2. The application is a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
3. The application will be structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
4. The application will be packaged and distributed using setuptools.
5. The application will have unit tests using pytest.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. Calculator class: This is the main class that performs the arithmetic operations.
   - add method: Adds two numbers.
   - subtract method: Subtracts one number from another.
   - multiply method: Multiplies two numbers.
   - divide method: Divides one number by another.
2. main function: This is the entry point of the application. It parses command-line arguments and calls the appropriate Calculator method.
3. test_calculator class: This class contains unit tests for the Calculator class.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
