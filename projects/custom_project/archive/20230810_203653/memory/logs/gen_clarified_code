The project will be a simple Python application that fetches data from an API and processes it.\n2. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API.\n3. The application will use the json library to parse the fetched data.\n4. The application will use dataclasses for structured data handling.\n5. The application will be structured in a modular way, with separate files for different functionalities.\n6. The application will have a main entry point file that ties everything together.\n7. The application will have a requirements.txt file listing all the necessary dependencies.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, Methods:\n1. `APIClient`: This class will be responsible for fetching data from the API.\n2. `process_data`: This function will process the fetched data.\n3. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application.\n\nNow, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom api_client import APIClient\nfrom data_processor import process_data\n\ndef main():\n    client = APIClient()\n    data = client.fetch_data()\n    processed_data = process_data(data)\n    print(processed_data)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nNext, let's move to the `APIClient` class in `api_client.py`.\n\napi_client.py\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nclass APIClient:\n    def __init__(self, url=\"https://api.example.com/data\"):\n        self.url = url\n\n    def fetch_data(self):\n        response = requests.get(self.url)\n        data = json.loads(response.text)\n        return data\n```\n\nNext, let's move to the `process_data` function in `data_processor.py`.\n\ndata_processor.py\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Data:\n    id: int\n    value: str\n\ndef process_data(raw_data):\n    processed_data = [Data(id=item['id'], value=item['value']) for item in raw_data]\n    return processed_data\n```\n\nFinally, let's create the `requirements.txt` file.\n\nrequirements.txt\n```\nrequests\n```\n\nThis completes the architecture of the application.
