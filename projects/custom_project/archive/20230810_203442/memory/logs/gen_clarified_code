We are creating a simple Python application that fetches data from an API, processes it, and stores it in a database.\n2. The application will be structured using an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.\n3. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API.\n4. The application will use SQLite as the database.\n5. The application will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.\n6. The application will use pytest for testing.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, Methods:\n1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the main function which will coordinate the fetching, processing, and storing of data.\n2. `api.py`: This file will contain the `Api` class which will be responsible for fetching data from the API.\n3. `model.py`: This file will contain the `Database` and `Data` classes. The `Database` class will be responsible for all database operations. The `Data` class will represent the data model.\n4. `controller.py`: This file will contain the `Controller` class which will be responsible for processing the data.\n5. `test.py`: This file will contain tests for the application.\n\nNow, let's write the code for each file.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom api import Api\nfrom model import Database\nfrom controller import Controller\n\ndef main():\n    # Create instances of Api, Database, and Controller\n    api = Api()\n    db = Database()\n    controller = Controller()\n\n    # Fetch data from API\n    data = api.fetch_data()\n\n    # Process data\n    processed_data = controller.process_data(data)\n\n    # Store data in database\n    db.store_data(processed_data)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\napi.py\n```python\nimport requests\n\nclass Api:\n    def __init__(self, url=\"https://api.example.com/data\"):\n        self.url = url\n\n    def fetch_data(self):\n        response = requests.get(self.url)\n        return response.json()\n```\n\nmodel.py\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass Data(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'data'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String)\n    value = Column(String)\n\nclass Database:\n    def __init__(self, db_url=\"sqlite:///data.db\"):\n        self.engine = create_engine(db_url)\n        Base.metadata.create_all(self.engine)\n        self.Session = sessionmaker(bind=self.engine)\n\n    def store_data(self, data):\n        session = self.Session()\n        for item in data:\n            data_item = Data(name=item['name'], value=item['value'])\n            session.add(data_item)\n        session.commit()\n```\n\ncontroller.py\n```python\nclass Controller:\n    def process_data(self, data):\n        # For simplicity, let's assume the processing involves filtering out data items where value is None\n        return [item for item in data if item['value'] is not None]\n```\n\ntest.py\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom main import main\nfrom api import Api\nfrom model import Database\nfrom controller import Controller\n\ndef test_main():\n    main()\n\ndef test_api():\n    api = Api()\n    assert api.fetch_data() is not None\n\ndef test_database():\n    db = Database()\n    assert db.store_data([{'name': 'test', 'value': 'test'}]) is None\n\ndef test_controller():\n    controller = Controller()\n    assert controller.process_data([{'name': 'test', 'value': None}, {'name': 'test', 'value': 'test'}]) == [{'name': 'test', 'value': 'test'}]\n```\n\nrequirements.txt\n```plaintext\nrequests\nsqlalchemy\npytest\n```\n\nThis completes the Python application.
