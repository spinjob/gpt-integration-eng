Assumptions:
1. We are creating a simple Python application that fetches data from an API, processes it, and stores it in a database.
2. The application will be structured using an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
3. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API.
4. The application will use SQLite as the database.
5. The application will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.
6. The application will use pytest for testing.

Core Classes, Functions, Methods:
1. `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will contain the main function which will coordinate the fetching, processing, and storing of data.
2. `api.py`: This file will contain the `Api` class which will be responsible for fetching data from the API.
3. `model.py`: This file will contain the `Database` and `Data` classes. The `Database` class will be responsible for all database operations. The `Data` class will represent the data model.
4. `controller.py`: This file will contain the `Controller` class which will be responsible for processing the data.
5. `test.py`: This file will contain tests for the application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
