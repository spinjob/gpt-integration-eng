We are creating a simple Python application that fetches data from an API and processes it.\n2. The application will be structured using a modular approach, with separate files for different functionalities.\n3. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API, and pandas for data processing.\n4. The application will be tested using pytest.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, and Methods:\n1. `APIClient`: This class will be responsible for fetching data from the API.\n2. `DataProcessor`: This class will process the data fetched from the API.\n3. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create instances of `APIClient` and `DataProcessor`, and coordinate their operation.\n4. `test`: This module will contain unit tests for the application.\n\nNow, let's write the code for each file.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom api_client import APIClient\nfrom data_processor import DataProcessor\n\ndef main():\n    # Create an instance of APIClient\n    api_client = APIClient()\n\n    # Fetch data from the API\n    data = api_client.fetch_data()\n\n    # Create an instance of DataProcessor\n    data_processor = DataProcessor()\n\n    # Process the data\n    processed_data = data_processor.process_data(data)\n\n    # Print the processed data\n    print(processed_data)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\napi_client.py\n```python\nimport requests\n\nclass APIClient:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.base_url = \"http://example.com/api\"\n\n    def fetch_data(self):\n        response = requests.get(self.base_url)\n        data = response.json()\n        return data\n```\n\ndata_processor.py\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nclass DataProcessor:\n    def process_data(self, data):\n        df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n        processed_data = df.describe()\n        return processed_data\n```\n\ntest/test_api_client.py\n```python\nfrom api_client import APIClient\n\ndef test_fetch_data():\n    api_client = APIClient()\n    data = api_client.fetch_data()\n    assert isinstance(data, list)\n```\n\ntest/test_data_processor.py\n```python\nfrom data_processor import DataProcessor\n\ndef test_process_data():\n    data_processor = DataProcessor()\n    data = [{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}, {\"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 25}]\n    processed_data = data_processor.process_data(data)\n    assert isinstance(processed_data, pd.DataFrame)\n```\n\nrequirements.txt\n```\nrequests\npandas\npytest\n```\n\nThis completes the architecture of the application. The `main.py` file is the entry point of the application. It imports and uses the `APIClient` and `DataProcessor` classes from the `api_client.py` and `data_processor.py` files respectively. The `test` directory contains the unit tests for the application. The `requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies of the application.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
