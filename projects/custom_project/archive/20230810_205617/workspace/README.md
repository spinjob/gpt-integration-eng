Assumptions:
1. We are creating a simple Python application that fetches data from an API and processes it.
2. The application will be structured using a modular approach, with separate files for different functionalities.
3. The application will use the requests library to fetch data from the API, and pandas for data processing.
4. The application will be tested using pytest.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `APIClient`: This class will be responsible for fetching data from the API.
2. `DataProcessor`: This class will process the data fetched from the API.
3. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application. It will create instances of `APIClient` and `DataProcessor`, and coordinate their operation.
4. `test`: This module will contain unit tests for the application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.py
